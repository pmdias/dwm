#+description: Personal fork of DWM

This repository is my personal fork of =dwm= and is not intended for others to
use, as most of the changes made to the vanilla =dwm= are made with the goal of
supporting my use cases and goals. Anyone is welcome to try to use this personal
fork anyway, but I wonâ€™t accept any pull requests or suggestions. The only
external changes to this repository will be the changes coming from the upstream
master branch.
